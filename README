## Handling Sensitive or Local-Config Files

Some configuration files, like `wpa_supplicant.config`, contain sensitive or machine-specific information (e.g., WiFi passwords). We want to:

- Include an initial version in the repository (so everyone has a template or starting point).
- Prevent accidental commits of local changes to these files (to avoid exposing secrets or overwriting personal settings).

### How to Ignore Local Changes to a Tracked File

After cloning the repository, run the following command to tell Git to ignore future local changes to the file:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged meta-mycustom/recipes-core/wpa_supplicant.config
